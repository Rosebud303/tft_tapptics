### T.F. Tapptics

...is an app designed around a recently released mini-game featured inside League of Legends. The app allows a user to build a fantasy team and see what statistics would be available to them based on their choices. The user will first be presented with a carousel, something mimicked from an in-game interaction, and will be allowed to choose a champion of their choice, just like the game allows. 

The user will then be allowed to play through and add to their team any champion they'd like, rather than the randomly generated champions the game produces. This allows for the unique aspect of our app where the user can plan and strategize their teams in advance of playing the game. Finally, the user will be able view information about in-game information, such as items and item stats, champions and champion stats, and class/origin stats.

The live application is available here.
The backend repository is available [here](https://github.com/tftapptics/tft_backend).
